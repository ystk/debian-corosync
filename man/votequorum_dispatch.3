.TH VOTEQUORUM_DISPATCH 3 2009-01-26 "corosync Man Page" "Corosync Cluster Engine Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
votequorum_dispatch \- Dispatches callbacks from the votequorum service
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <corosync/votequorum.h>
.sp
.BI "int votequorum_dispatch(votequorum_handle_t " handle ", votequorum_dispatch_t *" dispatch_types ");"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B votequorum_dispatch
function is used to dispatch configuration changes.
.PP
Each application may have several connections to the votequorum API.  Each  application
uses the
.I handle
argument to uniquely identify the connection.
.PP
The
.I dispatch_types
argument is used to identify the type of dispatch to execute.  The possible types are
defined by the structure:

.IP
.RS
.ne 18
.nf
.ta 4n 30n 33n
typedef enum {
        CS_DISPATCH_ONE,
        CS_DISPATCH_ALL,
        CS_DISPATCH_BLOCKING
} votequorum_dispatch_t;
.ta
.fi
.RE
.IP
.PP
.PP
The dispatch values have the following meanings:
.TP
.B CS_DISPATCH_ONE
Dispatch at least one callback, blocking until the callback is dispatched.
.TP
.B CS_DISPATCH_ALL
Dispatch all waiting callbacks without blocking to wait for any callbacks.
.TP
.B CS_DISPATCH_BLOCKING
Dispatch all callbacks blocking indefinitely.  This is used in a threaded
program where a thread is created, and then votequorum_dispatch() is called immediately
from the created thread to execute callbacks.

.SH RETURN VALUE
This call returns the CS_OK value if successful, otherwise an error is returned.
.PP
.SH ERRORS
The errors are undocumented.
