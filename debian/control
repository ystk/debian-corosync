Description: Standards-based cluster framework (daemon and modules)
 The corosync project is a project to implement a production quality
 "Revised BSD" licensed implementation of all core functionalities
 required by openais. The project implements cutting edge research
 on virtual synchrony to provide 100% correct operation in the face of
 failures or partitionable networks with excellent performance
 characteristics.
 .
 The Application Interface Specification is a software API and policies
 which are used to develop applications that maintain service during
 faults.
 .
 This package contains the corosync daemon and modules.
