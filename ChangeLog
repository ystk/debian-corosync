	Deliver all messages from my_high_seq_recieved to the last gap
	This patch passes two test cases:

	Two node cluster - run cpgbench on each node

	modify totemsrp with following defines:
	Two test cases:

	-------
	Test #2
	-------
	5 node cluster

	start 5 nodes randomly at about same time, start 5 nodes randomly at about
	same time, wait 10 seconds and attempt to send a message.  If message blocks
	on "TRY_AGAIN" likely a message loss has occured.  Wait a few minutes without
	cyclng the nodes and see if the TRY_AGAIN state becomes unblocked.

	If it doesn't the test case has failed

	Resolve a deadlock between the timer and serialize locks.
	This patch resolves a deadlock between the serialize lock (in
	exec/main.c) and the timer lock (in exec/timer.c).  I observed this
	deadlock happening fairly quickly on a cluster using the EVT service
	from OpenAIS.  (OpenAIS 1.1.4, Corosync 1.4.1)

	In prioritized_timer_thread(), it was grabbing:
	    1) timer lock
	    2) serialize lock

	In another thread, you have:
	    1) grab the serialize lock in deliver_fn() of exec/main.c
	    2) grab the timer lock in corosync_timer_add_duration().

	The patch just swaps the locking order in the timer thread.

	A CPG client can sometimes lockup if the local node is in the downlist
	In a 10-node cluster where all nodes are booting up and starting corosync
	at the same time, sometimes during this process corosync detects a node as
	leaving and rejoining the cluster.

	Occasionally the downlist that gets picked contains the local node. When the
	local node sends leave events for the downlist (including itself), it sets
	its cpd state to CPD_STATE_UNJOINED and clears the cpd->group_name. This
	means it no longer sends CPG events to the CPG client.

	coroipcc: use malloc for path in service_connect
	Coroipcc appropriately uses PATH_MAX sized variables for various data
	structures handling files in the initialization of the client.  Due to
	the use of 12 of these structures declared as stack variables, the
	application stack balloons to over 12*4k. This is especially problematic
	if threads are used by long running daemons to restart the connection
	to corosync so as to be resilient in the face of system services
	restarting (service corosync restart).

	A simple alternative is to allocate temporary memory to avoid

	In this situation deadlock appears.

	objdb: save copy of handles in object_find_create
	Following situation could happen:
	- process 1 thru confdb creates find handle
	- calls find iteration once
	- different process 2 deletes object pointed by process 1 iterator
	- process 1 calls iteration again ->
	  object_find_instance->find_child_list is invalid pointer

	-> segfault

	Now object_find_create creates array of matching object handlers and
	object_find_next uses that array together with check for name. This
	prevents situation where between steps 2 and 3 new object is created
	with different name but sadly with same handle.

	Also good to note that this patch is more or less quick hack rather
	then proper solution. Real proper solution is to not use pointers
	and rather use handles everywhere. This is big TODO.

	RRP: Fix ring initialization issue for UDPU mode
	Redundant ring has some problem in the UDP unicast mode. The problem
	is the second ring has not been successfully initialized, that is, the
	second time iface_changes happens, the member list for that interface
	has not been added, which results in that ring cannot transmit normal
	message. So the second ring cannot take over the work if the first
	ring is down. This patch fixes this issue.

	comments from review:
	More work is needed probably in totemnet where totemnet maintains the
	the of node list and an iterator for them, and totemudpu_member_add adds
	state information to a context for the iteration.

	In any regard, that is somewhat difficult to test, so I'll merge this
	patch for now - keep in mind interface changes on the bindnetaddr will
	cause problems with udpu after this patch has been commmitted.

	Fix shutdown when a confdb client is still connected
	If you are connected to corosync and registered for
	object notifications then corosync is asked to shutdown
	the IPC server will get stuck. This is because the pipe
	is closed and the refcount is increased. This leaves ipcs
	with a connection that it can't destroy.

	Solution:
	1) if a write to the pipe fails (pipe closed) decrement the refcounter.
	2) fix the object_track_stop() - it was not working as the functions
	   did not match up. (this caused the late callbacks).
	3) in ipcs call exit_fn() then stats_destroy_connection() so that
	   the service engine can have time to call object_track_stop()
	   before the object gets destroyed.

	confdb: send notifications from the main thread not IPC thread
	corosync-notifyd has exposed an issue with confdb notifications.

	The normal state of affairs is:
	IPC thread > lock > objdb > lock

	objdb notification whilst really useful turn things around:
	<middle of big call chain>
	objdb > lock > confdb > ipc > lock

	This reverse ordering of locks causes a horrible dead lock.

	I see this patch as a work around until corosync-2.0
	when most of the threads and locking disappear.

	This patch adds a pipe to confdb service. When we get a
	objdb notification a struct gets written to the pipe.
	The poll loop then runs the dispatch in the main thread.
	In the dispatch we call the real ipc_dispatch_send().

	totemsrp: free messages originated in recovery rather then rely on messages_free
	Relying on messages_free may seem like it should work, but it leads to a
	situation where every node has released the messages, yet some nodes think
	messages are missing.  The output then looks like "Retransmit: #" in
	repitition.  This patch frees those messages immediately during the transition
	to the OPERATIONAL state and sets the internal variables totemsrp depends
	upon to the proper values.

	Reviewed-by: Jan Friesse <jfriesse@redhat.com>

	totemsrp: Only restore old ring id information one time
	The current code stores the current ring information every time a commit

	totem.  This patch changes the behavior to only store the old ring id one
	time when the commit token is received, and then further commit token ring
	id saves are not done until OPERATIONAL is reached.

	Resolve abort during simulatenous stopping of atleast 4 nodes
	consider 5 nodes.

	node 3,4 stopped (by random stopping) node 1,2,5 form new configuration
	and during recovery node 1 and node 2 are stopped (via service service
	corosync stop).  This causes 5 never to finish recovery within the timeout
	period, triggering a token loss in recovery.  Bug #623176 resolved an assert
	which happens because the full ring id was being restored.  The resolution
	to Bug #623176 was to not restore the full ring id, and instead operate
	(according to specifications) the new ring id.  Unfortunately this exposes
	a problem whereby the restarting of nodes 1-4 generate the same ring id.
	This ring id gets to the recovery failed node 5 which is now in gather,
	and triggers a condition not accounted for in the original totem specification.

	It appears later work from Dr. Agarwal's PHD dissertation considers this
	scenario.  That solution entails rejecting the regular token in the above
	condition.  Since the ring id is also used to make decisions for commit token
	acceptance, we must also take care to reject the regular token in all cases
	after transitioning from OPERATIONAL.

	The flushing code was introducing data corruption because of recursion errors that occur as a result of the design of udpu.  Totem no longer requires the flushing technique because we don't mark a packet as missing until it has not been seen by a certain number of token rotations per a previous patch.  This mechanism was introduced to work around a problem in switches where multicast messages may be delayed by long periods compared to the unicast token.
	This patch removes the flushing logic from udpu since it is no longer necessary.

	select a new sync member if the node with the lowest nodeid has left.
	Problem:

	Under certain circumstances cpg does not send group leave messages.

	With a big token timeout (tested with token == 5min).
	1 start all nodes
	2 start ./test/testcpg on all nodes
	2 go to the node with the lowest nodeid
	3 ifconfig <int> down && killall -9 corosync && /etc/init.d/corosync restart && ./testcpg
	4 the other nodes will not get the cpg leave event
	5 testcpg reports an extra cpg group (basically one was not removed)

	Solution:
	If a member gets removed using the new trans_list and
	that member is the node used for syncing (lowest nodeid)
	then the next lowest node needs to be chosen for syncing.

	Merge trunk revision 2963: Fix OBJDB locking
	Patch fixes following situation:

	1. objdb receives reload notification and ends in function
	object_reload_config. This will call objdb_wrlock. I will call this
	thread #1

	2. Another thread will decide to update corosync statistics and calls
	object_key_increment. This calls objdb_rdlock. This thread is #2. But
	because condition (lock_thread != pthread_self()) is satisfied, it will
	also calls pthread_rwlock_rdlock. This will blocks, because thread #1
	holds the lock.

	3. object_reload_config will call reload functions (as real example
	xml2objdb). xml2objdb needs to calls object_create. This calls
	objdb_rdlock, but will hang on pthread_mutex_lock(&meta_lock), because
	this lock is held by thread #2.

	-> deadlock

	It is handled by using recursive mutex.

	Also every function is now really locked.

	Corosync has problem with readdir_r if pathconf function fails.

	Main problem is hidden in calling pathconf (internally calls statfs)

	was smaller than expected and memory was overwritten by readdir_r.

	Patch removes calling of pathconf and rather use NAME_MAX constant which

	Totem spec is clear:

	reject retransmitted tokens
	if token.aru = aru in token on last rotation ... do some logic

	Here is how the current code works:

	last_aru = instance->my_last_aru;
	instance->my_last_aru = token->aru;
	reject retransmitted tokens
	if token.aru = aru in token on last rotation ... do some logic

	The issue is last_aru will be set to token->aru when a token retransmission
	occurs before a new token arrives.

	This results in the "do some logic" part happening more often then it should.

	The static function 'decode_mode()' is used by the static function
	'dump_subsys_config()' which is is turn used by the static function
	'dump_full_config()' which is never used.

	Are these functions used by someone using some magic? I did not find
	any reference and even the flag LOGSYS_DEBUG, which prevents them from
	compiling, does not exist at some other point.

	If these functions are really not used, please remove them (because at
	least one of them has a buffer overflow). Patch against 1.2.3
	is attached.

	If there is a need for these functions, I'll send a patch to fix
	the 'decode_mode()' function.

	Kind regards

	coroipcc - don't loop forever on EINTR

	This patch unify behaviour of SYS V semaphores and POSIX semaphores.
	POSIX semaphores never return CS_ERR_TRY_AGAIN on EINTR and keeps
	waiting. This was fixed for SYS V semaphores in rev. 2303.

	Another change is to remove very small probability of hung forever in
	coroipcc_dispatch_put.

	Last change is removal of duplicate code by adding ipc_sem_wait function.

	When sync is aborted clear the "my_ring_id" variable.

	This patch fixes crashes found by repeated pacemaker CTS SimluStart
	tests. When you bring up the nodes together it can cause a lot of
	configuration changes and sync gets started and aborted
	lots of times.

	When abort is called the ring_id is not changed which means that any
	sync packet that arrive from that point on will be accepted as valid.
	I have seen old barrier messages causing the processing index to increment
	later causing an array out of bounds.

	This patch memsets the ring_id to 0, thus causing the ring_id in the packet and
	my_ring_id not to match.

	This patche fixes a couple of small problems with votequorum:

	- if a single node is booted with votequorum loaded then
	   corosync-quorumtool shows zero nodes and no votes.
	- votequorum doesn't always tell the main quorum module when a new node
	has joined the cluster (principally itself. this bug is actually tied
	into the above)

	I've also added quorum to the default list of services. As quorum has
	been decoupled from sync it will not interfere with normal operations as
	it used to do and it makes more sense to have it there than not.

	logsys: fix segfault in logsys_thread_priority_set

	logsys_thread_priority_set expects that wthread is already running
	but doesn't perform any check if it is.

	if logsys_thread_priority_set is invoked before forking the thread,
	a segfault is guaranteed.

	this changes to logsys_thread_priority_set ensure that a request
	for a new scheduler priority is queued if the wthread is not
	created yet and the new scheduler parameters are applied as early
	as possible after the thread is created.

	At the same time:

	- add a few comments on clean up that needs to be done
	- remove a redundant check for policy != SCHED_OTHER as that's
	  corosync need specific. logsys should simply accept the request
	  and apply it.

	Cpg synchronization patch for conf change messages

	The root of the theoretical problem is that cpg_join or cpg_leave
	messages are being sent via the C apis between synchronization.  With
	the current cpg, synchronization happens in confchg_fn, and then later
	in cpg_sync_process.  cpg_sync_process is called much later after
	confchg_fn and introduces a small probability of a window of time for
	queued in totem (but not yet ordered by totem) for those cpg_join and
	cpg_leave operations to interact with the synchronization process which
	should happen in one atomic operation but currently is two distinct
	operations.

	This patch deletes confchg_fn and make sends joinlist/downlist
	in cpg_sync_process.

	Allow only one connection per (node, pid, grp)

	This patch allows only one connection per (node, pid, grp_name) tuple.
	This means, you cannot make more connection from one process to same
	group_name. This is (I hope) how cpg should behave. In case, you will
	try to do that, CPG_ERR_EXISTS error is returned.

	Of course, there is no problem with creating:
	- more connection with same (pid, grp) if nodeid is different
	- more connection with same (node, grp) if pid is different (for example
	  after fork, or two distinct processes)
	- more connection with same (node, pid) if grp is different (connect
	  one process to more cpgs).

	Add assembly to free list when it is removed from a configuration change as indicated by being in the left list.
	This has side effect of clearing the assembly buffer the next time it is
	referenced from the free list.  This fixes a defect that stops forward
	processing of the message streams because sync fails to finish when receiving
	a sync message from a restarted processor because it throws away the message.

	flight recorder: enable temporary 0 buffer size protection
	The flight recoder doesn't handle a 0 byte allocation properly
	and it would fail miserably by allocating a single PAGE_SIZE
	to handle the logging. That means an enormous performance hit
	because of the constant wrapping around the buffer.

	If any requested buffer is < 64000 bytes, then force to at least
	64000.

	In future we will be able to handle small buffers properly, but
	for now enable a simple workaround to protect us and the user.

	flight recorder: switch from int to bytes for requested allocation
	The flight recoder buffer size as specified in LOGSYS_DECLARE_SYSTEM
	or _logsys_rec_init was expressed in number of ints. A developer asking
	to allocate 512K would get a 2M allocation on a machine with sizeof(int) = 4.

	This is confusing and the patch addresses it:

	- rename rec_size to fltsize for external API (no type change),
	  because rec_size is used many times internally for other reasons
	  and it can be confusing.

	- rename size to fltsize in _logsys_rec_init.

	- document what we allocate and why.

	- swap comments around to match the code.

	- introduce a simple macro to perform rounding (stolen from linux-2.6.git).

	- start shaping fdata header to better handle dynamic values:
	  * write the flt_data_size as first unsigned int the header.
	  * change corosync-fplay to read the value and alloc the right amount
	    of memory instead of hardcoding it again.

	Handle LCR problem with unloading "unneeded" components
	In LCR, global variable g_component_handle is used to keep handle of loaded
	component. If this variable has magic value (0xFFFFFFFF) it means, 
	"we loaded library, but that library doesn't have any component_register 
	call -> don't try to destroy interfaces list).

	If this variable has other value, it means "we loaded library, it registers,
	but it exports some interface, what we currently don't need, so we can delete
	that handle from libraries/interfaces list" and variable is set to magic value,
	or "we loaded library, it registers and exports what we need -> great return some
	nice value", but nobody resets variable to it's magic value.

	Sadly, if you have loaded some component (needed), then try to load component,
	which don't have component_register function, previously loaded component handle
	is destroyed. 

	This problem happened to clm and quorum services, and cause, that loaded
	clm handle was destroyed, so EVT (which need clm) just falls.

	Decouple the decouples shutdown/startup order of lcrso's from the internal objdb order.
	This is needed as the objdb order will change as modules are loaded/unloaded and is 
	also set up to unload non-default services last (which is the opposite of what 
	something like Pacemaker needs).

	In the worst case, the current behavior leads to cluster services (dlm, ocfs2, etc) 
	failing during shutdown.  This patch also ensures that if, for example, cpg is unloaded 
	then anything that depends on it is unloaded first.

2009-06-01  Jan Friesse  <jfriesse@redhat.com>

	Fix coroipcc linking
	Fixes rhbz#499918
		
	Functions from ckpt library (like aCkptCheckpointOpen,
	saCkptSectionIterationInitialize, ...) internally uses corosync functions
	reply_receive, reply_receive_in_buf, ... This functions are included in
	coroipcc.c source file and uses global static variable ipc_hdb.

	Without patch, coroipcc is linked to shared library (libcoroipcc.so) AND linked
	with every corosync libraries (like cpg, ....), so global variable ipc_hdb is
	included not only in libcoroipcc.so, but also in libcpg.so, ...

	dlm_controld has function retrieve_plocks, and whole binary is linked with
	libcoroipcc and libcpg. So ipc_hdb is included TWICE (so has TWO addresses).

	Main problem causing the bug was, that reply_receive uses address from one
	library, and reply_receive_in_buf uses other. This confuses check of hdb_get
	function.

	After removing linking of coroipcc.o to cpg, and rather use of dynamic version,
	 (this means, there is only one instance of ipc_hdb) problem disappeared.

	It has a priv_data_pt parameter that is used like this:

	  struct totem_config *totem_config = priv_data_pt;

	and totem_config is in turn passed as arg #2 to
	totem_volatile_config_read, where it is decidedly non-const.

	1) kill all those "for" shell loops. They are dangerous (as they don't report install failures) and it's just overhead since $(INSTALL) can do the same.
	2) make sure to create our directories with $(INSTALL). Not sure I did
	catch them all yet, but at least a good bunch. This also fix the
	corosync.conf install error I introduced in the previous commit.

	3) Handle SONAME automatically. This is the most intrusive change across
	the board:

	 * configure.in now defines the system wide SOMAJOR, SOMINOR, SOMICRO
	and SONAME and exports them to the Makefile.
	 * exec/Makefile.am, lib/Makefile.am are now updated to use those vars
	rather than hardcoded version.

	4) Bump the SOMAJOR to 3 as agreed since we did change both API and ABI.

	Quorum checks the ring ID is new before initiating a sync. Unfortunately it copies the ring ID BEFORE checking it so there is always a match.

2009-03-06  Christine Caulfield  <ccaulfie@redhat.com>

	The IPC patch broke CFG shutdown in several places, this patches fixes all of them.
	In particular, cfg_try_shutdown asks all applications that are
	registered for callbacks if they approve the shutdown. This caused a bit
	of a re-entrancy problem because it also asked the process that called
	for the shutdown! The patch causes cfg to only ask OTHER applications in
	the assumption that any application that calls
	corosync_cfg_tryshutdown() will approve of the action :-)

	In addition it adds the response to cfg_replyto_shutdown which was
	missing (it couldn't be used with the old system but is mandatory now),
	and removes a double-free in the library finalise code.

	This patch fixes some minor bugs in the expected_votes behaviour and adds a couple of new features:
	- When total_votes exceeds the expected_votes value then expected_votes
	is increased to that value.

	When a quorum device registers it tells the corosync quorum engine of the new quorum which then tries to do a new sync(). But that's no use because the nodelist and ring_id is identical to before. Also it can try and register while a sync is already in operation ... which gets it awfully stuck!
	So this patch makes the sync conditional on there being a new ring ID to
	do a sync on.

	quorum is now an optional loadable module (though I've put it into the defaults in services.c) and can load another module to do the quorum work (eg YKD which I've made more compliant too). All the quorum code has been removed from sync.c. quorum.c is simply a shim later for the coroapi, the main module is in vsf_quorum.c
	There are coroapi calls to query quorate status and also to get
	notifications when it changes.

	I've included the testquorum.lcrso module in this patch because I think
	it's really helpful for testing. It sets the quorum state based on an 
	objdb variable, this can be set or cleared using corosync-cfgtool

	Correctly compare local addresses with bindnetaddr
	This patch allows whitetank/corosync to behave correctly when the supplied value of bindnetaddr has more precision than the netmask, but is not a full IPv4 address.

	For example, currently, if the netmask is /16 but the user specifies 192.168.1.0, then OpenAIS is unable to determine the correct address and uses the loopback address instead.

	The following patch allows OpenAIS to correctly determine which interface/address to use.

	to let corosync be shut down. If they all agree then the rest of the
	cluster will be informed before the node dies.

	This is an initial pass at a top-level quorum system. As it stands, this module doesn't provide quorum itself, merely a framework for setting and querying it. I envisage YKD plugging into this rather than straight into sync() eventually.
	I've plugged this into the sync() routines rather than replacing them so
	that quorum is itself a VSF, rather than a replacement - I'm not sure if
	that is best or not. Opinions are welcome.

	I've added an extra enum member to the service_handler so that we can
	send IPC messages when the cluster isn't quorate. This will default to
	NO (as now) but allows us to query and set quorum when we don't have it
	.. a useful feature !

	Propagate the flow control state between AIS exec and library
	This patch causes the flow control state in the library to be set
	properly when the flow control is turned off (disabled).  Then it can be
	read properly by the flow control apis.
	This also fixes the case where the application is no longer sending
	messages and it has already dispatched all its received messages
	before flow control is disabled.

	Also, CPG response messages with a TRY_AGAIN error did NOT contain
	a valid flow control state value. This meant the library could get
	stuck with flow control enabled (flow control was never enabled
	for the EXEC, so no disable event occurred).
	This case was hit when a new node was joining - sync_in_process()
	resulted in a TRY_AGAIN for error cpg_mcast_joined).

	Also, in message_handler_req_exec_cpg_mcast() the state passed
	back to the library defaulted to disabled for messages received
	from another node (even if flow control was still enabled)
	- this meant if multiple nodes were sending CPG messages,
	  then the library flow control state flip-flopped between
	  enabled and disabled.

	If syslog() blocked, node-leave events were incorrectly reported
	In some cases, the syslog() call may block. If this happened, the AIS worker
	thread would block waiting on the syslog() call. However, the worker thread
	is still holding a logsys mutex, which is needed to enqueue any more log
	messages from the other AIS threads. So the main AIS thread blocks waiting
	on the logsys mutex. This can then cause aisexec on other nodes to detect
	the node as leaving the cluster.

	This patch adds key_increment and key_decrement calls to the objdb and confdb subsystems.
	This is useful to provide atomic counters (ag handle numbers) for
	long-running (though not persistent) connections. It's not currently
	possible via confdb to atomically get a new number from objdb due to the
	lack of locking. Doing it via increment operations in the IPC thread
	provides enough atomicity to make it useful. Fabio has already
	identified a use for these calls.

	It could also provide some form of basic co-operative locking mechanism
	for IPC-using processes (not direct objdb calls).

	Remove the disliked *_from calls from the objdb and recast the confdb library to use the new find_create/find_next/find_destroy API calls instead.
	I've kept the libcondfb API the same as before with the single change of
	adding a confdb_object_find_destroy to tidy up the find handle after
	use. If you don't call this then libcondfb will do it for you when
	confdb_finalize is called.

	Zero out unused totemsrp my_proc_list entries
	When making my_proc_list smaller, ensure that the
	now non-used entries are zero-ed out. There are some suspect
	assert's that assume that there is always 2 entries in the list.
	These fail when my_proc_list is reduced to 1 entry (and the
	valid [0] entry is the same as the 'unused' [1] entry).

	aisexec crash on exit
	Cause:
	As part of its exit procedure, ais cancels its worker thread then manually
	processes any outstanding items that were still in the worker thread's queue.
	The worker thread has a low priority so normally it does not execute any
	further before ais finishes exiting, but if the main thread's exiting is
	delayed for any reason, there is a chance the worker thread could execute and
	try to process items which have already been processed and freed by the main
	thread - often leading to the worker thread seeing NULL data and ultimately
	causing a segmentation fault.

	Fix:
	Modified worker_thread_group_exit() so it does a pthread_join() after the
	pthread_cancel() call, so that the worker thread always shuts down cleanly
	before the main thread does its cleanup.

	Provide a way to configure (at compile time) message and queue sizes.
	This patch makes it possible to override the following #defines:
	MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX
	MESSAGE_QUEUE_MAX
	SIZEQUEUE
	FLOW_CONTROL_ENTRIES_ENABLE

	If MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX is defined as 1024*64 (64K) and
	MESSAGE_QUEUE_MAX defined as 512 you can change corosync's
	memory footprint from ~48M to ~8M

	So if you define MESSAGE_QUEUE_MAX, the queue size will
	not be based on the message size any more.

	To use this define the defines on the command line:
	make CFLAGS="-DMESSAGE_SIZE_MAX=1024*64 -DMESSAGE_QUEUE_MAX=512"

	Use a 2 phase "commit" operation:
	1) Invoke verifyconfig that should catch the errors before the reload operation
	2) Invoke reloadconfig that performs the operation and should _never_ fail

	Implementation note: if step 2 fails, there is no fall back at the moment.

	Fixes the following problems: 1) the encapsulated and not encapsulated values for multicast messages are now enumerated instead of magic number. 2) the endian detector is now set for new encapsulated messages intended for transmission.  previously these messages would use whichever endian detector value happened to be in memory which could be a) correct endian b) incorrect endian from another machine byte order message c) junk values. 3) The retransmission flag is not set by default on new originated tokens in the recovery state.  Instead it is set based upon whether the node actually can retransmit any messages. 4) some workaround code was removed that was necessary to make the system work when #3 was incorrect 5) the my_install_seq and my_aru fields are compared based upon a window instead of static comparison because it could be that the my_aru is 0xFFFFFF5 where my_install_seq is 5.  In this case (after a lot of messages are sent) the comparison would return the incorrect result in the recovery phase of the algorithm. 6) The queue chosen for adding messages to the retransmission queue is now set based upon the encapsulated bit rather then the current state of the state machine. 7) the encapsulated bit is set properly in an endian conversion operation for a multicast message header.

	is unlocked successfully, as well as code to do it, obviously.

	Correct not initialized value  of  amf_comp in amf_comp_find_from_conn_info ()
	git-svn-id: http://svn.fedorahosted.org/svn/corosync/trunk@1322 fd59a12c-fef9-0310-b244-a6a79926bd2f

	This patch contians:
	-  AMF handles a component report of injurious health.

	- AMF handles saAmfHealthcheckConfirm() SA_AIS_ERR_FAILED_OPERATION
	so that if it's a recent recovery ongoing amf does nothing but if it's
	no  immediate recovery in progress, AMF invokes the recovery action
	specified by the component when the health check is started If
	the individual recommendation was SA_AMF_NO_RECOMMENDATION,
	then AMF uses the configured recovery action for the component
	(saAmfCompRecoveryOnError). If this recommendation also is
	SA_AMF_NO_RECOMMENDATION, then AMF makes a component restart or
	component/SU fail over counts on the value of
	saAmfCompDisableRestart and saAmfSUFailover.

	- Handling of cleanup of a component and health check response hardened.


	- Time supervision and check return value of clc-cli CLEANUP command.


	- Handle 'recommended recovery' specified by a component in an error
	report. The potential recovery action to  choose
	implemented is - component restart - and - node fails over.

	- The attribute saAmfCompDisableRestart is now recognizable which means
	that if the component specifies 'Component restart' and restart is
	disabled
	then the SU in which the component is contained shall fall over.

	- The attribute saAmfSUFailover will not be recognized. SU will always
	  fail
	over as a single entity.

	- A component can report an error on another component than itself.


	- Implementation 'Instantiation Level' according to chapter 3.9.2 in the
	AMF specification.
	- Implementation of the escalation levels, component restart, SU
	restart, SU fail over and Node fail over.

	Patch contains:
	A mechanism to defer and recall simultaneous
	events in the state machines for amf_cluster,
	amf_application and amf_sg.

	The implication of this defer and recall mechanism is
	that it's now possible to to recover from e.g. several
	simultaneous SU failures in an ordered serialized manner.

	The events that could be deferred/recalled so far is
	SG_FAILOVER_NODE_EV,SG_START_EV,SG_FAILOVER_SU_EV,
	CLUSTER_SYNC_READY_EV,APPLICATION_START_EV and
	APPLICATION_ASSIGN_WORKLOAD_EV.

	Files involved:

	Index: exec/amfsg.c
	Index: exec/amfutil.c

	This simple patch solves a problem we see when testing AMF. If a node leaves and joins the cluster quickly (within one second is default), the config change messages will not indicate that the node left and rejoined. The patch introduces a short delay in main() to make sure the token_timeout expires.

2006-10-04  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	The patch contains:
	 The instantiaton of the component is performed with some new steps:
	 
	 1. SU invoke Comp to instantiate
	 2. Comp multicast a new event 
	 MESSAGE_REQ_EXEC_AMF_COMPONENT_INSTANTIATE
	 3. Comp receive the new  event 
	 MESSAGE_REQ_EXEC_AMF_COMPONENT_INSTANTIATE
	 4. If the Comp is within the SU hosted on the node. The 

	 component invokes

	    the clc_cli instantiate script to start the component 

	 and start a timer

	    to supervise the start and registration of the component.
	 5. If the instantiation time elapse before the component has 
	 registered himself
	    Comp is sending a new multicasted event
	    MESSAGE_REQ_EXEC_AMF_COMPONENT_INSTANTIATE_TMO.
	 6. Comp receive 

	 MESSAGE_REQ_EXEC_AMF_COMPONENT_INSTANTIATE_TMO event.

	 7. The Comp presence state is set to 
	 SA_AMF_PRESENCE_INSTANTIATION_FAILED
	 8. When all Components are in presence state 

	 SA_AMF_PRESENCE_INSTANTIATED or

	    SA_AMF_PRESENCE_INSTANTIATION_FAILED the start or restart will 
	 continue with
	    the assignment of load.
	 
	 This implemntation means that the complete instantiation procedure 
	 never will be endlessly waiting for a register. The 

	 instantiation will 

	 either turn out in a component instantiation failure or a success.
	 
	 
	 Hardening of the cluster start use case:
	 
	 1. A clearer separation of the responsibilities between 

	 amf_cluster and

	    amf_application.
	                      
	 2. A clearer interface and separation between amf_main (amf.c) and 
	 amf_cluster.
	 
	 3. A clearer interface and separation between amf_cluster 

	 and amf_node.

	 
	 4. A clearer separation of the responsibilities between amf_node and
	    amf_application.

	- New sync state machine, implemented and described in amf.c - One AMF node reads the AMF config file (IMM style) - One AMF node syncs others AMF nodes - One AMF object is serialized and sent as one message - Serialization/deserialization of most objects is trivial (memcpy) except for component and csi-attributes objects which have variable size arrays/strings. - Depth first AMF object tree traversal preserves relations when syncing - Ordered lists of SUs and SIs - Constructors/destructor per class - Serializers/deserializers per class - Config-change changes sync state - Sync callbacks executes the sync - "Use case" tracing for sync using the SYNCTRACE macro (trace6) - Sync master is initially the winner of a timeout race and if the master leaves the cluster, the node with the lowest node ID becomes new master. - amf_malloc implements an AMF central malloc routine with error handling.

	This patch checks the result of read operations on a socket which can return errors or 0.  Now if those cases happen, the operation is ignored.  This part of the code needs more attention later to handle short reads.  This removes a warning when fortify source is defined to the compiler.

	getaddrinfo() doesn't actually set errno, it has its own error variable, so returning -errno is not useful (it may be zero even if getaddrinfo failed).
	So, simply return -1 if getaddrinfo fails, to indicate a name resolution
	or badly formed address.

2006-03-16  Steven Dake  <sdake@redhat.com>

	Patch from Hans Feldt This small patch (against r948) adds variable CPPFLAGS to all make rules that compiles `.c' files into `.o' files.
	This makes it possible to set CPPFLAGS on the command line as in:

	$ make CPPFLAGS=-DAMFDEBUG

	Editing the makefile when prototyping is then not needed.

	Another reason is that some of the openais C files are built using the 
	implicit rule for C files (which uses CPPFLAGS). The change makes rules 
	consistent with the implicit rule.

	It also adds a few missing files to the clean make target.

	The current event service code will start rejecting received events after 4gig because it thinks that they are duplicates. This update fixes that problem.  Now I am keeping a full 64 bit id for checking for duplicate/re-sends, etc.  separate from the event ID.  I also check that a new event ID is not in use by a retained event.

	values in the B spec.

	I discovered that our SaAisErrorT is incorrect.  I have included a patch to fix that.  The SA_AIS_ERR_BAD_CHECKPOINT code doesn't exist.  I replaced it with SA_AIS_ERR_BAD_OPERATION.

	Some fixes to the event service based on the saftest event tests results.
	The changes may affect applications currently using the event service. 

	1. Timeout value to the saEvtChannelOpen call was updated to use
	SA_TIME_MAX instead of 0 for infinite timeout.

	2. added cleanup in the library to remove associated events when a
	channel is closed, and remove associated channels when finalize is
	called.

	3. Added some new checking args for NULL and returning the correct error
	code.

	4. fixed dispatch to return correct status with SA_DISPATCH_ONE and no
	available poll data.

	5. Makefile had bad dependency for evt library build.

	Add missing mutex unlocks in evt dispatch function.
	BKrev: 41dec6bdm_JzS8aFCPMDziJhBZprSw

	I was running into a problem where the evt api appeared to be getting into a deadlock situtation. The problem would occur when I would kill aisexec while my program was running (using EVT and CLM apis). My program is multi-threaded where 1 thread is calling evtDispatch and other threads can be calling evtPublish at various times. The problem I ran into is when I killed aisexec, the evtDispatch would take a lock, but never give it back. At the same time, my sending thread would call evtPublish which would take the lock and hang since evtDispatch never gave up the lock it took.
	The fix was to add a few unlocks in evt.c where they appeared to be missing.
	Here is the info:

	1) line 504 in evt.c (lib dir) calls

	pthread_mutex_unlock(&evti->ei_mutex);
	goto error_unlock;

	2) There are subsequent calls to goto error_unlock in later error statements
	that do not unlock the mutex before the goto call - the lines are 534 and 541

	Adding the unlock right before the goto @ 534 and @ 541 fixes the deadlock
	for my scenario.

	evt code updated to handle cluster config changes better.  Now, when a node joins, it is sent any retained events that have time left on them. Also, if the joining node had been a part of the cluster in the past, it is sent the next event ID that it should use so as to not generate duplicate event IDs. Channel open requests are now completed in the exec handler, with channel close code to follow later.

	Store handle address in timer structure.  When timer expires, wipe out the handle address's value, since the timer is no longer valid. This allows double frees, or frees on handles that haven't been added. One note of caution: a handle cannot be moved into another variable and be expected to work properly for double frees.

	This changeset includes major fixes to the IPC from the executive to the library.  Also included is an entirely new API called the EVS api (Extended Virtual Synchrony).  This API provides EVS semantics for those developers that require this model of programming.  The API is defined in include/evs.h and is very simple.
	The API provides:
	group semantics with 32 byte group keys.
	delivery callback
	configuration change callback
	join one or more groups
	leave one or more groups
	multicast a message to the instance's joined groups
	multicast a message to any other group

	Makefile:
	  Add the testevs and evsbench targets.
	evs.c, testevs.c, evsbench.c, evs.h:
	  new file
	Makefile:

	  This allows the message buffer for saRecvQueue to be
	  small, but allows receiving very large messages.

	  to the library.  What was there previously was very
	  broken.
	gmi.c:
	  Fix bug where transition from multiple members to
	  single members would cause messages not to be sent.
	  Also fixed an assertion in transition from multiple
	  processors to one processor.

	Priorites added to dispatch function.  This is in prep for flow control to allow dispatch functions that haven't been serviced in awhile to be bumped up in priority when they are not serviced.
	The priority of the dispatch handler is passed to the dispatch
	function which can modify it in place.  The new priority will be
	used the next time the poll system call is executed.

	main.c:
	  Add library accept handler at lowest priority
	gmi.c:
	  Make gmi highest priority when adding dispatch functions
	aispoll.h, aispoll.c:
	  Add priority to poll abstraction
	  Higher priority items will be serviced first

	  When a processor left the membership, the next configuration would sometimes
	  cause a form token timeout.  While not particularly harmful, it was wasteful
	  and not part of the original design of the group messaging protocol.
	  There was some extra junk code that was added to workaround some other bug
	  that has since been fixed.
	  This junk code removed and now the form token never times out (woohoo).
	  Also removed some extra code that calculates the next ORF processor twice.

	Retransmit orf token if no multicast or token received within a timeout period.  This could mean that the token was lost, but no configuration change has really occured.  Rather then execute the heavyweight membership protocol, just retry the token and if it fails after the token timeout, execute a configuration change sequence.

	The group messaging interface has been exported as a library for use in other programs.  The key interfaces are exec/gmi.h and exec/poll.h. gmi.h describes the interface for group messaging, while poll.h describes the interface for abstracting poll system call with timers and integrated with gmi. By including these headers in programs and linking with libgmi, it is possible to use the virtual synchrony layer (group messaging interface) used in AIS for other applications.

	Fix binding rules so that instead of binding to INADDR_ANY for UDP sockets, bind to specific interface defined in network.conf. This is done by creating two fds.  gmi_fd_token is used for all token communication.  gmi_fd_mcast is used for all mcast communication.  I'm not sure if gmi_fd_mcast binding rules is correct.  Once work begins on multipathing, this will have to be figured out :)
